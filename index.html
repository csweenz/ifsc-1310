  <h2 id="prog">Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
  <p>Modern websites contain many creative functionalities that are constantly updated, remixed, and broken by the many different types of web users.  
  While many webpages rely on advanced scripting and server-side networking, not all users are capable of appreciating or even using a lot of common features.  This can be due 
  to lack of adequate hardware, computer or biological, or it could be something more complicated like operating system requirements or internet bandwidth issues.  Whatever the reason, 
  we should not design websites to exclude users suffering from these common problems.</p>
  <br>
  <p>The answer lies in the concept of 'progressive enhancement'.  This idea states that there is a heirarchy of functionalities on the web.  Developers should focus on the most common 
  features accessible to all, providing a passing user experience for most, and then add more complex features redundantly or superfluously. Animated pictures and text created using CSS or javascript should complement 
  HTML5 features such as alt text and image titles, for instance.  Slideshows and parallax background images should be organized and behind text containers, in case the scripts or styling 
  do not render in a user's browser.  In addition, common features of major web browsers should be the focus, rather than niche features in an experimental browser.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Related to progressive enhancement is the concept of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Graceful_degradation">graceful degradation</a>, which points out that websites should work in older browsers, 
   otherwise, you risk providing an unusable experience for a majority of your visitors.  Most web users are rarely as excited about updating software as a skilled web developer.</p>
